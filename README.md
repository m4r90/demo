# demo personnal skills 
 
I would like to show my skills throughout this website. 

## Programming languages used

For the beginning of the website I'll use mostly html and a little bit of css.
Then I'll add more information and upgrade the css.
I'll learn Javascript to add more special effects in my website.

### Techniques

I will use animation, transitions, effects, parallax.

## Theme of the website

The website will be about DnD, Dungeons and Dragons. I play this role play game sometimes and know a few things about it. I find it very interesting and I know that choosing this topic is one of the best ideas to show my skills. Mainly because it's a fantastic game which gives room to a lot of imagination.
